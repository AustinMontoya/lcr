	<h1>Welcome to the Learning Content Repository</h1>
 	<p>
 		The Learning Content Repository (LCR) is a research effort designed to ease 
 		in discovery, access, re-use, and creation of Learning Content. The initial focus will
 		emphasize SCORM content, but future iterations shall include rich support for other
 		types of learning resources as well.
